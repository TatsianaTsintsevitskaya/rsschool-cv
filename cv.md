==========================================================

In 2003 I graduated from the Belarusian Statie Uneversity of Culture and Arts. I work in a music school as a piano teacher. I am married. I have two childern. I want to develop in the field of IT technologies in order to navigate the trends of the modern world, change the type of activity to update my thinking (including in the learning process) and realize myself in a new business.
